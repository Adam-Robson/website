              LE FOG makes independently produced music for people who
              have an ear for intentional and carefully created arrangements. The
              sounds are confronting while understated, and dreamy but grounded.
            </p>

              LE FOG's music is entirely independent; the songs are crafted, recorded,
              mixed, produced and released by the artist. The composition holds nothing for
              decoration; every note is placed with intention. It draws you in
              like an unexpected and fluid conversation - tethering you for
              the moment, folding time as it passes, unnoticed.
            </p>

              The lyrics lead you to yourself. They surface and linger, like a
              fragment of an inner monologue, something forgotten along the
              way, but is immediately familiar when witnessed. Simultaneously existential
              and unpretentious; a thoughtful rebellion. The catalog stands on its own,
              and there is plenty to explore.
